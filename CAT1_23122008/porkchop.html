                This Honey Garlic Pork Chops Recipe is so easy you won’t believe it when it’s done! No marinating
                needed, this recipe is an incredibly quick and delicious way to serve bone in or boneless pork chops —
                seared until golden then simmered and broiled (or grilled) in the most amazing honey garlic sauce!
            </p>

            <h2> Pork chop recipes</h2>
            <p>
                The demand for this recipe has been overwhelming! Since publishing my Easy Honey Garlic Chicken recipe
                years ago, the amount of emails coming in asking for a pork chops version has been crazy! Crazy GOOD
                because this recipe is one of the best pork recipes we’ve ever had. Delicious, juicy and tender chops
                that melt-in-your mouth.

                All done in a skillet or oven-proof pan then finished off under the broiler (or grill) for a couple of
                minutes to get those crisp edges. That last step is so worth it! Just look at the colour! You will not
                regret serving these Honey Garlic Pork Chops to your family!

            <h2>Pork chop marinade — no marinating needed!</h2>
            <p>

                Melt butter in the same pan as the porks were seared in to keep those flavours going into the sauce,
                then add the rest of your ingredients.
                Cook until the sauce reduces down and thickens slightly (about 3-4 minutes). Don’t cook for too long or
                the honey will reduce down completely, leaving you with a dry pan. (If that happens, just make another
                batch of sauce only to serve with later.)
                Baste pork generously with the sauce, then broil/grill for 1-2 minutes, or until edges are slightly
                charred.
