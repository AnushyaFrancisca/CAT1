                When you think of Bolognese, what do you think of? Probably a tomato-y, meaty pasta sauce, which is
                exactly what it is, but with a couple of specifics. “Bolognese” means in the style of Bologna, the
                capital city of of Emilia-Romagna, in northern Italy.

                Essentially, Bolognese is a ragu (meat based sauce served over pasta) made famous in Bologna and now
                popular worldwide. Typically, Bolognese includes: meat (a mix of beef and pork), a classic soffritto
                (onion, celery, carrot), wine, milk or cream, and tomatoes. Bolognese in Bologna is almost always served
                with tagliatelle.

                Nowadays it seems like every tomato based meat sauce is called Bolognese. I’m sure the people of Bologna
                would disagree 9 times out of 10. This sauce is pretty close to the classic with just a couple of
                twists.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bolognese vs meat sauce
                Bolognese is meat sauce but not all meat sauces are Bolognese. The main difference is that a meat sauce
                is a tomato based sauce simmered with ground beef and various vegetables. Bolognese is a much more
                complex sauce with layers of flavor. It’s velvety rich, thicker, creamier (thanks to milk), and just
                straight up better.
            </p>
            <h2>The secret to a good Bolognese</h2>
            <p>
                Building out flavors is key to why this bolognese works, whether you only have one hour or 6. Thirty
                minutes and an Instant Pot will give you something truly delicious but if you can slow simmer for 6
                hours, the sauce will become next level. The ingredients layer together in a way that builds up, leaving
                you completely satisfied. These are reasons why this Bolognese is going to be the best you’ll ever make:
            </p>
            <h2>Beef and pork</h2>
            <p>
                Most meat sauces out there – including the ones masquerading as Bolognese only call for beef. But for a
                really good Bolognese, you need a mix of beef and pork, not only for the different flavors, but for the
                differing fat contents. Pork adds a lighter umami sweetness that pairs well with the deeper flavors of
                beef. Plus ground pork tends to be a bit fattier than ground beef, giving the sauce a richness that you
                won’t get from just using beef alone.
            </p>
            <h2>Soffritto</h2>
            <p>
                The holy trinity of aromatic vegetables are onions, carrots, and celery, otherwise known as soffritto.
                Slow cooking soffritto in olive oil gently coaxes out an immense amount of flavor and complexity.
            </p>
            <h2>Cheese</h2>
            <p>
                Finish with cheese, always! Freshly grated parmigiano reggiano (get the DOP good stuff) adds saltiness,
                nuttiness, and so much umami. This bolognese is finished with a shower of fresh cheese and you should
                definitely have more at the table, so you can add as you wish.
