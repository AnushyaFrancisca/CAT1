                A perfect sweet and savoury 5-ingredient garlicky sauce with a hint of lemon will become your family’s
                new salmon obsession. Honey Garlic Salmon = dinner ready in under 15 minutes, including prep time!

                If you love juicy, tender, succulent salmon, this is the post for you! Slow roasted salmon in a sweet,
                savory, slightly spicy sauce, finished with caramelized limes, fresh scallions, and toasty sesame seeds.

                I feel like everyone loves salmon. When it’s cooked properly, it’s so flavorful and satisfying. The
                finicky part with salmon is that when it’s over cooked, it’s a dry, crumbly travesty. Salmon is kind of
                mysterious but it’s really one of the easiest, healthiest, and tastiest proteins you could ever learn to
                make.

            <h2>The best baked salmon recipe</h2>
            <p>

                This oven baked salmon is spicy, sweet, savory, and so addictive. The gochujang honey glaze is AMAZING.
                If you’ve ever had Korean fried chicken, the glaze is very similar to that sticky, bright red, deeply
                delicious sauce you get on the spicy wings.

            <h2>Best salmon for baked salmon</h2>
            <p>

                Go for a larger cut of salmon instead of individual fillets: a larger piece of fish means it won’t dry
                out as much in the oven; a large piece of fish is much more forgiving than smaller fillets. You can
                either go for skin on or skinless. I went with skin on because the skin provides an extra layer of
                protection against over baking.

                Since we’re going to flake the salmon in pieces and present it on another platter, I recommend skin on
                so the salmon stays a bit juicer. Either way, make sure you remove the pin bones, if there are any. Run
                your fingers lightly across the surface of the fillet, near the middle. If you feel any pin bones, use a
                pair of kitchen tweezers to pluck them out.

            <h2>What is gochujang ?</h2>
            <p>
                
                A savory, sweet, spicy fermented paste made from chili powder and sticky rice. It adds sweet and heat
                and a ton of flavor to your favorite Korean dishes. We use it for Korean fried chicken, oven roasted
                chicken, and Korean BBQ. Traditionally it comes in tubs, but these days you can find it in squeeze
                bottles in the Asian aisle of literally any grocery store (or online, as always).
