                The coziest risotto recipe topped with an egg and plenty of parm! Super creamy, super comforting, and
                so, so delicious.

                I LOVE risotto. It’s kind of retro and not really popular at modern restaurants, but creamy, cheesy
                rice? Um, yes please! To me, it’s the perfect kind of fancy, kind of out of the ordinary dish I love
                making, either on weeknights or special occasions.

                Risotto was one of the very first things I ever learned how to cook when I first moved out! I have to
                admit, the very first time was a disaster. I must’ve spent hours at the stove, stirring until I thought
                my arm was going to fall off. It was way back in the day when blogs or cooking wasn’t as popular as it
                is now and I didn’t have much to go on and I didn’t know that you’re supposed to heat the stock before
                you add it to the rice. Even after hours of stirring, the rice was still crunchy.

                Mike ate it and said it was good, but I knew he was just being nice…Anyway, many, many pots of risotto
                and many recipes later and lesson learned. I’m here to give you all the tips and tricks to making the
                perfect risotto with the best and coziest recipe out there!

            <h2> What is risotto?</h2>
            <p>
                Risotto is an Italian rice dish where the rice is cooked in a specific way to become gooey and creamily
                delicious, yet still firm, in a way most other rice dishes aren’t. Properly cooked risotto becomes rich
                and creamy due to the grains of rice rubbing against each other and releasing their starch into the
                cooking liquid. The grains of rice are al dente and separate, while still kind of fluid.

                Italians say that it is all’onda, which means that it’s kind of flowing and wavy – they’re talking about
                how when it’s served on a flat plate the risotto spreads out but isn’t super liquid. Risotto comes in
                many different regional flavors and in more modern ones too. My favorite is mushroom but I also like a
                carbonara-type risotto with crispy guanciale, egg, and pecorino.

            <h2>How to make risotto?</h2>
            <p>
                1. Bring a pot of stock up to a simmer. Keep the stock hot so it can cook the rice while you’re
                stirring.
                <br>
                2. Cook the aromatics. Gently cook your aromatics: onions, shallot, or garlic in some butter or oil
                until
                soft, but not brown. Deglaze the pan with a bit of wine, stirring, until most of the wine is cooked off.
                <br>
                3. Toast the rice. Stir the rice into the aromatics, being sure to coat each grain of rice with
                butter/oil.
                Coating the grains of rice with fat before adding any liquid helps them cook evenly so the outsides
                don’t become mushy before the insides get tender.
                <br>
                4. Add the stock. Slowly ladle in the hot stock, while stirring, so the grains of rice rub up against
                each
                other and release their creamy starches. Continue to add stock and stir until the rice is just cooked
                through, creamy, and al dente.
                <br>
                5. Finish and serve! Stir in some butter and cheese to finish, taste and season with salt and pepper.
                Enjoy
                immediately!
