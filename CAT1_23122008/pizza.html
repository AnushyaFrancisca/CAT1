                The first time I heard of making pizza on a grill all I could think of was, why would anyone want to do
                that?

                Now that I've done it more than a few times I can think of several reasons, the first being who wants to
                heat up an oven to 450°F or higher on a hot summer day?
            </p>

            <h2> Grilled Pizza is a Game-Changer</h2>
            <p>


                If you use a grill to make pizza, you can keep the heat outside where it belongs. Grills also better
                mimic a wood fired oven than your conventional indoor oven.

                Whether using charcoal or gas, the smoke from the grill will help give your pizza great flavor that you
                simply cannot get from a regular oven.

                It's also easy! No, the pizza dough does not fall through the grill grates. Assuming you've properly
                heated the grill, your dough will form a lovely lightly browned crust.




            </p>
            <h2>How to Grill Pizza the Smart Way</h2>
            <p>

                The trick is that you cook the plain dough first, on one side, on the grill. Then remove it, flip it,
                brush the grilled side with sauce and toppings, and return the pizza to the grill for final cooking.
            </p>
            <h2>Make Ahead Instructions</h2>
            <p>

                Dough: Make a double batch of the dough, let it rise, then divide it, wrap it in plastic and freeze it.
                Then, when you want pizza for dinner, take the dough out of the freezer and put it into the fridge
                before you go to work, and when you come home take it out of the fridge and put the dough on the counter
                to warm while you heat up the grill.
                Pre-grill crusts: Just stretch out the dough and grill it lightly on both sides. Let the crust cool on a
                rack so that the heat and steam on the underside of the crust don't make it soggy. You can make several
                this way, a few hours ahead of time. Then when you are ready to grill again, paint the crusts with
                sauce, add toppings, and grill.
